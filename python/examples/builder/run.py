Builder quickstart.

The same POST /execute flow as examples/quickstart/run.py, built with
create_business_transaction() instead of constructing all five nested
dataclasses and keeping three id pairs in sync by hand. Compare this
file to examples/quickstart/run.py directly -- the difference is the
entire point: every "X must match Y" 400 response documented in
END-TO-END-FLOW.md (repo root) came from hand-building a request and
getting one of those pairs wrong. This function makes that class of
mistake structurally impossible.

See README.md in this directory for prerequisites and expected output.
