        # it, so only the outermost level would still look like a
        # dataclass to the `is_dataclass(value)` check below -- an
        # unset `| None = None` field on any NESTED dataclass (e.g.
        # BusinessTransactionMetadata.granted_capability inside
        # BusinessTransaction.metadata) would fall through to the
        # dict branch instead, which has no None-filtering at all, and

        # attribute values instead keeps every nested dataclass a
        # genuine dataclass instance when `encode()` reaches it, so

        # the top one.

        # that at all) -- so an unset field here means "absent",

        # Runtime side. Sending it back as an explicit `null` instead
        # changes what a re-hash (e.g. RefusalApi.verify(), which
        # re-hashes whatever canonical bytes it receives) computes,
        # breaking verification on a serialization difference alone,
        # not a real integrity problem -- and, as observed against a
        # live server, can also trip a strict `!== undefined` check
        # downstream (e.g. DefaultConnectorPolicy.assertAllowed's
        # grantedCapability check) that a genuinely absent key would
