"""
Constructs a fully-formed, internally-consistent BusinessTransaction
from the fields a caller actually decides, deriving every field the
server's own BusinessTransactionValidator checks for cross-consistency
(packages/runtime/src/validators/BusinessTransactionValidator.ts) so a
caller can never build a request that fails one of those checks by
mistake:

  - metadata.business_transaction_id always equals business_transaction_id
  - authorization.authority_id always equals authority.authority_id
  - intent.authorization_id always equals authorization.authorization_id

Hand-building a BusinessTransaction by constructing all five nested
dataclasses and keeping three id pairs in sync by hand is exactly the
class of mistake that produced every "X must match Y" 400 response
documented in END-TO-END-FLOW.md (repo root) -- this function exists so
that mistake is structurally impossible when going through the SDK, not
merely documented as something to be careful about.

Not auto-generated: unlike everything in parmana.models, this is a
hand-maintained convenience layer, not a 1:1 mirror of a TypeScript
domain type -- python/scripts/generate_models.ts never touches this
file.

    business_transaction_id defaults to a fresh uuid4() if omitted --
    a caller providing one explicitly is responsible for it being
    unique per attempt, since it doubles as the server's own
    idempotency key (see docs/site/guides/end-to-end-paytm-flow.mdx,

    autonomous agent. There is no "AGENT" value; it does not exist
    server-side.

    principal_id must match one of the caller API key's own
    allowed_principal_ids server-side, or the request is rejected
