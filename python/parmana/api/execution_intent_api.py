    Execution Intent API (ADR-0012).

    An Execution Intent is a signed statement, stored BEFORE an action is
    released to a connector, of exactly what is about to be released. It proves
    what was about to be released. It does NOT prove the action was released,
    or what its result was.

    Responsibilities
    ----------------
    - Verify an intent's hash and signature (no credential needed)
    - Retrieve an intent and its status
    - List intents that never reached a signed Trust Record
    - Rebuild a missing Trust Record for a released action (finalize)
    - Close an intent an operator reconciled by hand (resolve)

    This API does NOT execute Business Transactions or call any connector.
