/**
 * The sandbox's retention job (deploy/sandbox/retention.sql, ADR-0014 open
 * question 3) deletes old Business Transactions. Every table that
 * references business_transactions does so ON DELETE RESTRICT, so the job
 * must delete from each of them first, or the daily run fails. These tests
 * read the migrations, so a new table that references business_transactions
 * fails here until the job deletes from it too. They also keep the job's
 * guards: it refuses a database without the sandbox registration, keeps
 * governance, and is never a migration.
