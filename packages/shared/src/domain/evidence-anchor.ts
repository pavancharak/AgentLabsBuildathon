 * session" note).
 *
 * Not a NEW cryptographic guarantee -- policyContentHash,
 * governanceAnchor, and connector evidence were already bound together
 * implicitly, since all three sit inside the same ExecutionTrustRecord
 * that trustRecordHash/signature already cover in full. What this adds
 * is a single, explicitly-named, independently-computed pointer an
 * auditor can check WITHOUT already knowing to reach into
 * transaction.policy and executions[].evidence.attributes.connector
 * separately and reconstruct the binding themselves -- the exact
 * "here's proof they're linked" artifact the originating gap audit
 * asked whether one existed.
 *
 * Absent when there is nothing to anchor at all (no policyContentHash,
 * no governanceAnchor, no connectorEvidenceHash -- should not occur for
 * any real ExecutionTrustRecord, since G-24 always stamps
 * policyContentHash, but the type stays honest rather than assuming).
