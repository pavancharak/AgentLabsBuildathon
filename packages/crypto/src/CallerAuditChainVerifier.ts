/**
 * Verifies one caller's full audit chain (SupabaseCallerAuditSink's
 * per-caller chaining): each row's signature against its own
 * recomputed content -- including the previousChainHash/chainPosition
 * fields folded into what was actually signed -- and that each row's
 * previousChainHash references the immediately-preceding row's own
 * chainHash. No network call, no database, no running Parmana
 * process: pass it rows already fetched from storage, in ascending
 * chain_position order. The same standalone discipline
 * docs/site/guides/verify-independently.mdx demonstrates for
 * ExecutionTrustRecord, extended to the caller-audit trail.
 *
 * A deleted row breaks this: the row after it still carries the
 * deleted row's chainHash as its own previousChainHash, but the
 * row before it has a different chainHash -- the linkage check below
 * catches the mismatch, which is exactly the gap this class closes
 * (see docs/site/trust-and-claims/objections-and-evidence.mdx,
 * Domain 3).
 *
 * Rows with no chain fields at all (no callerId at write time --
 * the earliest possible rejection, or caller.rejected) are verified
 * for signature only, never required to link -- the same "absent
 * means unprotected, not broken" discipline
 * ExecutionChainCrypto.verifyChain() already applies to legacy,
 * pre-chain-feature Executions.
