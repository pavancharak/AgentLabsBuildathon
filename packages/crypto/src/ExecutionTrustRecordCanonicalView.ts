/**
 * The exact canonical view of an Execution Trust Record that is
 * hashed and signed -- extracted out of VerificationCrypto (which
 * still delegates here, unchanged behavior) so there is exactly one
 * implementation of "which fields participate in the signature,"
 * shared by the online verifier (VerificationCrypto, which resolves
 * keys via FileKeyProvider) and the offline verifier
 * (OfflineVerifier.ts, which takes public keys directly and never
 * touches disk, env vars, or the network). Two independent
 * reimplementations of this field list would be a correctness risk in
 * their own right -- exactly the kind of drift a third-party verifier
 * must never have to guess at.
 *
 * PQC audit RED-1 (docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md): before this file
 * existed, this mapping lived only as a private method on
 * VerificationCrypto, so a third party had no way to reconstruct it
 * without reading this repository's source directly -- not documented
 * anywhere @parmana/sign's own README or this project's public docs
 * describe.
