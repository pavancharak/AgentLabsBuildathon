 * GET /ready
 *
 * Readiness probe, distinct from /health's pure liveness check: this
 * one actually touches Postgres with one cheap query (`SELECT 1`,
 * transferring no table rows, just confirming the connection and
 * credentials work) so a PaaS orchestrator can tell a process that is
 * up but backed by dead storage apart from one that is genuinely
 * ready to serve traffic — and route around it accordingly.
 *
 * When storage is not Postgres backed (NODE_ENV=test, or
 * PARMANA_STORAGE=memory outside test), there is no external
 * dependency to probe, so this reports ready unconditionally — the
 * same distinction assertStorageConfigured.ts already draws at boot.
 *
 * Queries via a direct Postgres connection (PostgresPoolFactory), not
 * supabase-js/PostgREST — this probe previously depended on
 * PostgREST for a `consumed_nonces` HEAD request, which meant a
 * PostgREST-layer outage (the exact incident class this migration
 * removes) could make the readiness probe itself unreliable.
