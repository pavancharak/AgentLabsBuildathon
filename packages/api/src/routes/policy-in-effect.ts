/**
 * GET /policies/in-effect?capability=<action>
 *
 * The policy a request for a capability must declare right now: the
 * bound policy name and, where policy governance decides it, the
 * version most recently approved (G-66). An agent reads it instead of
 * writing a version into its code, so approving a new version needs no
 * change to the agent. It is the same rule POST /execute enforces
 * (CapabilityPolicyBinder.policyInEffect), so the answer cannot
 * disagree with enforcement; the agent still declares the version in
 * its request, and the request is still checked.
 *
 * The answer also says what a request must carry, without the rules:
 * the policy's description, and its signal requirements (every fact the
 * rules read, their declared types, the facts that must equal a value of
 * the Intent, and the facts that need a signed approval with what that
 * approval names). An agent builds its request from these instead of
 * from a copy of the policy. Rule conditions are not returned; the
 * description is the policy author's own text.
 *
 * Who may ask: a caller whose key may invoke the capability, or a human
 * caller. Responses:
 * - 200 { capability, policy: { name, version, schemaVersion },
 *   description, signals: { facts, schema, bound, approval } }
 * - 400 capability missing
 * - 403 CAPABILITY_NOT_ALLOWED
 * - 404 CAPABILITY_NOT_BOUND: no policy is bound to it
 * - 409 NO_APPROVED_POLICY_VERSION: every request is refused until one
 *   is approved
 * - 503 POLICY_VERSION_UNAVAILABLE: the lookup failed; every request is
 *   refused meanwhile
