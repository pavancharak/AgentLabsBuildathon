 * so the resolved value's field name (privateAppToken) matches
 * HubSpotConnector's own HubSpotCredentialValue shape exactly, and so
 * error messages can name HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN specifically.
 *
 * HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN's presence is still what decides whether
 * this connector is registered at all (unchanged, synchronous). Its
 * *value* is resolved through SecretsProvider (ADR-0009) only inside
 * resolve(): in the default "env" mode that's an identity pass-through
 * (the value already is the token, same as before this existed); in
 * "aws-secrets-manager" mode, the env var instead holds the Secrets
 * Manager secret name/ARN to fetch the real token from. Never logged,
 * never embedded in a thrown error (only the variable name
 * HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN ever appears in messages).

 * Test (NODE_ENV=test): a static privateAppToken, overridable via
 * TEST_HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN — read directly, with no intermediate
 * bridge variable. This is a deliberate lesson learned from the Razorpay
 * connector's own history (docs/CLAIMS.md 3.4): its NODE_ENV=test branch
 * originally read a word-order-swapped bridge variable
 * (TEST_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID/SECRET instead of the documented
 * RAZORPAY_TEST_KEY_ID/SECRET), which depended entirely on call sites
 * remembering to copy one into the other and was fixed only after the
 * fact. HubSpotCredentialProvider reads TEST_HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN —
 * the exact name documented in .env.example — from its very first
 * version, with no bridge to get wrong.
 *
 * Production: HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN. If unset, this returns
 * undefined rather than a partially-configured provider or a fallback to
 * mock credentials. createConnectorRegistry.ts does not register the
 * HubSpot connector at all in that case, so hubspot:deal-fetch /
 * hubspot:deal-update simply have no connector to resolve to
 * (ConnectorSdkRegistry.resolveCapability's existing "No connector
 * registered for capability" fail-closed error) — rather than a startup
 * crash that would also take down every other, unrelated capability this
 * process serves.
