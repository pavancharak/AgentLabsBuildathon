 * slack-post-message 1.0.0 approves when the caller declares
 * contentApproved and channelAuthorized true, and binds only channelId
 * to the Intent's target. The connector posts to parameters.channel,
 * which nothing compared with the target. So an agent could post
 * anything to any channel the bot is in, by its own word, or name an
 * allowed channel in target and post to another one.
 *
 * A post passes only when parameters.channel is a string, equals the
 * target, and is in the allowlist. Anything else is reported as a
 * channelAuthorized violation, so the request is refused before
 * authorization and again at release. An empty or unset allowlist
 * refuses every post (fails closed). Other actions are not touched.
