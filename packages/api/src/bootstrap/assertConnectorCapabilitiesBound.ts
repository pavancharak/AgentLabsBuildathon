 *
 * Why this exists: CapabilityPolicyBinder only protects capabilities it
 * knows about — an action with no canonical entry is silently
 * unaffected by it (see CapabilityPolicyBinding.ts's own doc comment in
 * @parmana/capability-registry). Today every capability actually
 * registered in production (hubspot:*, github:*) already has a binding,
 * so this assertion currently never fires outside test-fixture's own
 * exemption below — its purpose is making sure the NEXT connector added
 * can't silently ship the same gap.
 *
 * Called from createConnectorRegistry.ts once every registration is
 * built, before the registry is handed back to the rest of bootstrap —
 * a violation must stop the process before it ever binds a port, not
 * surface later as a missing protection someone has to notice on their
 * own.
