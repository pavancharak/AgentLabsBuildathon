/**
 * Production implementation of PolicyExecutionVerifier (@parmana/policy).
 * Wired into RuntimeEngine only when POLICY_EXECUTION_VERIFICATION_ENFORCED
 * is enabled (see createPolicyExecutionVerifier.ts) -- when it is, no
 * policy executes without a PolicyChangeApprovalRecord whose signature
 * verifies and whose contentHashAfter matches the content actually
 * being evaluated.
 *
 * Reuses exactly the same three checks
 * verifyPolicyGovernanceIntegrityAtStartup.ts already performs for
 * every governed policy on an interval -- this class performs them
 * for one policy, synchronously, in the request path, at the moment
 * that specific policy is about to be evaluated, rather than
 * discovering a bypass up to 5 minutes (or a full deploy cycle) after
 * the fact.
