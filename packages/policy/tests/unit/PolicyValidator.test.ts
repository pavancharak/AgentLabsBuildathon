 * Gap #1 (boundSignals coverage): PolicyValidator validates boundSignals
 * shape and rule-condition shape independently, but never related them
 * -- a rule could approve on a fact with no boundSignals entry, silently
 * forfeiting SignalIntentBinder's protection for that fact. This started
 * as an additive, warn-only cross-check; G-32 [policy-authoring audit,
 * 2026-09-09] made it fail-closed via validate() (see the second describe
 * block below) once unboundSignalReasons gave policy authors a way to
 * explicitly acknowledge a genuinely unbindable fact instead of silently
 * leaving it unmentioned.
