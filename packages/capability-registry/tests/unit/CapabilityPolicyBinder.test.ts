/**
 * Found by an independent repository verification (Phase 2K, TD-22):
 * nothing bound a capability to the one policy that authorizes it.
 * boundSignals/SignalStateVerifier protections are declared per-policy
 * and per-action respectively, so a caller could pair a real capability
 * (e.g. hubspot:deal-update) with an unrelated, unprotected policy
 * (e.g. vendor-payment/2.0.0, which declares no boundSignals for it)
 * and bypass those protections entirely, since PolicyEngine.evaluate
 * takes no action parameter and nothing else cross-checks policy
 * identity against capability identity. This is the regression suite
 * proving that gap is now closed.
 *
 * Moved here from packages/policy/tests/unit (G-30 architecture follow-up,
 * Option C: docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md G-30)
 * when CapabilityPolicyBinding.ts itself moved into its own package,
 * @parmana/capability-registry, specifically so a future consumer that
 * needs to know "is this capability bound, and to what" doesn't have to
 * depend on all of @parmana/policy to find out.
