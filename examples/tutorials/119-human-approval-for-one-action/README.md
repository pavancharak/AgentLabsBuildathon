# Tutorial 119: human approval for one action

## Objective

Show a person signing off on one critical action: a refund above the automatic limit runs
only with a signed approval from a trusted manager, for that order and at least that
amount, used once. It uses the real `policies/customer-refund/1.1.0/policy.json` and the
real components the server runs.

## What the policy says

| Refund amount         | Result                                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| up to 10000           | approved automatically                               |
| above 10000 to 100000 | needs `managerApproved`, backed by a signed approval |
| above 100000          | refused, approval or not                             |

`managerApproved` is declared in the policy's `approvalSignals`:

```json
"approvalSignals": {
  "managerApproved": { "resourceId": "parameters.orderId", "value": "parameters.amount" }
}
```

So the signal counts as `true` only when `signals.approvalArtifact` holds an approval that
`ApprovalSignalVerifier` accepts: signed by a trusted, not revoked approver, not expired,
for `paytm:refund`, for this order, with an amount limit at least the amount in the
request (taken from the request, never from the agent's signals), and never used before.

## The steps

1. A refund of 5000 is approved with no person involved.
2. A refund of 75000 with no manager is refused (`reject-manager-approval-required`). The
   server also writes a signed Refusal Record, which a manager can review.
3. The agent sends `managerApproved: true` with no approval: refused.
4. The manager signs an approval for this order, up to 75000, for 15 minutes, and the agent
   sends a new request with it: approved.
   - The gateway checks the approval again just before release, without using it up.
5. The same approval sent again: refused. An approval is used once.
6. An approval up to 75000 used for a 90000 refund: refused.
7. An approval for another order: refused.
8. A refund of 150000 with an approval: refused by the policy maximum.

The tutorial runs the policy first and then, only for a provisional approve, the approval
check, in the order `RuntimeEngine` runs them.

## Run

```bash
npx tsx examples/tutorials/119-human-approval-for-one-action/run.ts
```

It is also part of `npm run examples`. Hermetic: the manager key is generated in memory
and nonces are kept in memory.

## In production

1. The manager runs `scripts/generate-approver-key.ts` on their own machine. The private
   key never leaves it.
2. The operator adds `{ approverId, keyId, revoked: false, publicKeyPem }` to
   `TRUSTED_APPROVAL_ISSUERS` in `packages/api/src/bootstrap/createApprovalIssuerRegistry.ts`
   and deploys.
3. For each refund that needs it, the manager signs with `scripts/sign-approval.ts`
   (`--capability paytm:refund --resource-id <order> --max-amount <amount>`), and the agent
   sends the result in `signals.approvalArtifact` with `managerApproved: true`.
