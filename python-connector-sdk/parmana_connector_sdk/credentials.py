"""
Credential resolution seam.

Credential resolution happens exclusively inside the Execution Gateway (via a
CredentialVault backed by one of these providers). Connectors never resolve,
retrieve, discover, or store credentials themselves -- they only ever receive
an opaque, already-resolved CredentialHandle.

This module defines the interface seam for future providers (HashiCorp
Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager). Only the
seam is defined here; no cloud SDK integration is implemented.
