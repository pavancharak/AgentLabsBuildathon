# Chapter 9: The Execution Authorization Envelope

## What it is

A `SignedExecutionAuthorization` is the cryptographic proof that Parmana decided a specific
request should execute. It's what crosses the boundary between "Parmana decided APPROVE" and
"a connector actually did something in the real world." Its own doc comment states the
guarantee directly: "Enterprise systems should execute only requests carrying a valid,
verified `SignedExecutionAuthorization`." Nothing downstream is trusted to re-derive that a
decision was made; the envelope carries the proof itself.

## Why it was built

Without a signed, independently verifiable authorization, a connector (or anything holding
the ability to call one) would have to trust that whatever called it had genuinely gone
through `RuntimeEngine`, with no way to check. The envelope makes "was this actually
authorized, by this exact decision, under this exact policy content, for this exact content,
within this time window" a question anyone downstream can answer themselves, from the
envelope alone, without a network call back to Parmana. Every field on the payload
(`packages/shared/src/domain/execution-authorization.ts`) exists to close one specific gap
this system's own incident history (Chapter 22) found real.

## How it works

`ExecutionAuthorizationPayload` (the signed content) carries:

| Field                          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`                      | Must be `1`. A verifier rejects any other value, including a missing field, before even attempting signature verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `authorizationId`              | Unique identifier for this authorization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `nonce`                        | Single-use. A receiving system must reject a previously-seen nonce, replay protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `decisionId`                   | The approved `Decision` this authorization corresponds to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `businessTransactionId`        | The transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `policyName` / `policyVersion` | Which policy produced the decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `authorizedAt` / `expiresAt`   | ISO-8601 UTC. A receiving system must reject an expired authorization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `businessTransactionHash`      | Canonical hash of the `ExecutableContent` (`businessTransactionId`, `action`, `target`, `parameters`) approved for execution, computed identically on the signing side (from the runtime's in-memory transaction) and the verifying side (from the JSON-parsed request), so a mismatch means the payload was modified after signing while keeping the same `businessTransactionId`. |
| `policyContentHash` (optional) | The G-24 content hash of the _exact policy document_ that produced this decision, not merely the version string. Optional so authorizations signed before this field existed keep verifying, absent means "not covered by the policy-freshness check," never "policy is stale."                                                                                                     |
| `signalsHash` (optional)       | Canonical hash of the runtime signals evaluated for this decision, the real-world conditions (vendor status, risk exposure, etc.) that justified it, distinct from both the content hash and the policy hash.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `submittedBy` (optional)       | The authenticated caller identity, when caller-auth was enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `grantedCapability` (optional) | The capability the caller-to-capability check confirmed this caller was permitted to invoke, carried forward as a signed fact rather than discarded once the request passes, a receiving system can confirm this equals the executed action, catching any divergence between what a caller was cleared for and what's actually presented for execution.                             |

The complete envelope (`SignedExecutionAuthorization`) wraps this payload with `signature`
(over the canonical serialization of the payload, see Chapter 3 for `CanonicalSerializer`),
`keyId` (so a verifier can select the right public key), and `algorithm`.

Signing happens in `RuntimeAuthorizationSigner` (`packages/runtime/src/RuntimeAuthorizationSigner.ts`),
which composes `@parmana/crypto`'s `AuthorizationSigner` against whichever `Signer` (
`LocalFileSigner` or `KmsSigner`, resolved once through `SignerBootstrap`, see Chapter 3) is
configured, using a per-tenant key resolved through `TenantKeyResolver` (falling back to the
shared `"default"` key when no tenant-specific key exists). `RuntimeEngine.execute()` calls
this once, at the "Authorization" step (Chapter 8, step 12), only ever reached after policy
evaluation approved the request.

Verification happens twice, in two different places, checking different things:

1. **`@parmana/envelope-verifier`'s `EnvelopeVerifier`**, used by `ExecutionGateway`
   (Chapter 10), checks the envelope itself: version, signature, expiry, TTL policy, then the
   `businessTransactionHash` recompute-and-compare, then (if wired) the policy-freshness and
   signal-freshness checks, then nonce consumption last (the only side-effecting check, run
   only once everything else has passed).
2. Anyone holding the receiving system's copy of Parmana's public key can independently
   re-verify the same signature offline, without calling back to Parmana at all, this is
   what Chapter 18 (Independent Verification) covers.

## How it enables things, with examples

- `examples/tutorials/11-execution-authorization`, the payload itself, signed and inspected.
- `examples/tutorials/26-execution-authorization-verification`, independent verification.
- `examples/tutorials/27-authorization-expiration`, the `expiresAt` check rejecting a stale
  envelope.
- `examples/tutorials/29-authorization-tampering`, mutating a signed payload and watching
  signature verification catch it.
- `examples/tutorials/31-authorization-binding`, the `businessTransactionHash` binding
  content to the authorization.
- `examples/tutorials/41-expired-authorization`, `43-stolen-authorization`, further negative
  cases against the same envelope.

## How to validate this yourself

- `packages/shared/src/domain/execution-authorization.ts`, the type definitions; every claim
  above about a field's purpose is quoted or closely paraphrased from this file's own doc
  comments.
- `packages/runtime/src/RuntimeAuthorizationSigner.ts`, the signing side.
- `packages/crypto/src/AuthorizationSigner.ts`, `AuthorizationVerifier.ts`, the shared
  signing/verification logic.
- `packages/envelope-verifier/src/`, `EnvelopeVerifier`'s own check ordering.
- `packages/runtime/tests/unit/execution-authorization-wiring.test.ts`, proves the fields get
  populated correctly from a real `RuntimeEngine.execute()` call.

## Integration requirements

- A configured signer (`KEY_PROVIDER=local` with `PARMANA_KEY_DIR`, or `KEY_PROVIDER=aws-kms`
  with the relevant AWS configuration, see Chapter 3).
- `EXECUTION_AUTHORIZATION_TTL_SECONDS` (defaults to 120 per this repo's own `.env`) controls
  how long a signed authorization remains valid before a receiving system must reject it.
- A receiving system that wants to verify authorizations itself needs Parmana's public key ,
  see Chapter 18 for the discovery mechanism (`GET /keys/:keyId`, `/.well-known/jwks.json`).
