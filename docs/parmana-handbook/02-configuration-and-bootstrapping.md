# Chapter 2: Configuration and Bootstrapping

## What it is

Every runtime-configurable choice Parmana makes, which storage backend, which signature
algorithm, where keys live, whether caller authentication is on, flows through exactly one
function: `loadConfig()` in `packages/shared/src/config/Config.ts`. Everything downstream,
from which `Signer` gets constructed to whether the process refuses to start at all, is
derived from the single immutable object that function returns.

## Why it was built

`Config.ts`'s own doc comment states the goal plainly: "Centralized immutable configuration.
This is the only configuration model used by Parmana." The practical reason is fail-closed
startup. A process that boots successfully, passes `/health`, and only fails on its first
real request (because a key file is missing, or a database is unreachable) is worse than a
process that refuses to start at all. Several files across `packages/api/src/bootstrap/`
exist specifically to convert what would otherwise be a lazy, request-time failure into an
eager, startup-time one, and their own comments say so directly: `assertSigningKeyMaterialConfigured.ts`
opens with "Without this, `FileKeyProvider` only throws lazily... A production process could
otherwise boot 'successfully', pass `/health`, and only fail on its very first real request."

## How it works

### `loadConfig()`, section by section

`loadConfig()` (`Config.ts:305-381`) reads `process.env` exactly once per call and returns a
frozen `Config` object with eleven sections: `environment`, `storage`, `crypto`, `keys`,
`secrets`, `authorization`, `policy`, `trust`, `api`, `auth`, `rateLimit`, `logging`. Every
value is parsed and validated through `ConfigValidation.ts`'s `parse*` functions, each of
which throws immediately on an unrecognized value rather than silently falling back to a
default. Two sections fail closed even harder, by refusing an _unset_ value rather than just
an invalid one: `requirePolicyDirectory()` throws if `PARMANA_POLICY_DIR` is unset, and
`assertSigningKeyMaterialConfigured.ts` (a separate, startup-only check, not inside
`loadConfig()` itself) does the same for `PARMANA_KEY_DIR`.

`.env` resolution is location-independent: `findEnvFile()` walks up from
`Config.ts`'s own directory until it finds a `.env` file, so every package in the monorepo
shares the same configuration regardless of which package's `cwd` a script happens to run
from.

### The full environment variable reference

Every variable below is read somewhere in this monorepo; `.env.example` is the canonical
list (351 lines, heavily commented) and was the primary source for this table, cross-checked
against `Config.ts`/`ConfigValidation.ts` for the ones that carry a real enum.

A genuine discrepancy worth flagging directly: `.env.example`'s own comment on `KEY_PROVIDER`
says "Only `local` (FileKeyProvider) has an implementing class today, setting this to any of
the other four values does nothing." That statement is now wrong. `SignerBootstrap.ts`
(Chapter 3) implements `aws-kms` for real, via `KmsSigner`. The comment predates that work and
was not updated afterward, exactly the kind of drift this book exists to catch rather than
repeat.

### `*Bootstrap` classes: composition roots, not dependency injection

Three classes in `packages/crypto/src/` follow an identical shape: a static `create()` method,
a private static cache, construction driven entirely by `loadConfig()`.

- **`CryptoBootstrap`** (`CryptoBootstrap.ts`) builds a `CryptoProvider` (hash + signature)
  for a given algorithm, registering built-in providers (`SHA256HashProvider`,
  `Ed25519SignatureProvider`, `Dilithium3SignatureProvider`) into `HashRegistry`/
  `SignatureRegistry` and selecting by `config.crypto.hashProvider`/`primarySignatureProvider`.
  `createHybrid()` builds both primary and secondary providers at once for `CRYPTO_MODE=hybrid`.
- **`KeyBootstrap`** (`KeyBootstrap.ts`) is the older `KeyProvider` composition root. Its own
  doc comment is unusually direct about its current status: `KEY_PROVIDER` accepts five
  values for forward compatibility, but "only `FileKeyProvider` (`local`) is actually
  implemented," and it throws loudly for anything else rather than silently falling back
  to file-based keys, closing a real prior gap where a misconfigured `aws-kms` value used to
  parse cleanly and then quietly construct a `FileKeyProvider` anyway.
- **`SignerBootstrap`** (`SignerBootstrap.ts`) is the newer, signing-capable sibling
  (Chapter 3 covers `Signer` vs `KeyProvider` in full). Unlike `KeyBootstrap`, it supports
  both `local` (`LocalFileSigner`) and `aws-kms` (`KmsSigner`) for real, and is deliberately
  **not** memoized the way `KeyBootstrap.create()` is, a static singleton here previously
  poisoned test isolation, since each test sets its own `PARMANA_KEY_DIR` and a cached signer
  would keep pointing at a deleted temp directory across tests.

### Startup order, traced from `server.ts`

`packages/api/src/server.ts` runs, in this exact order:

1. `assertStorageConfigured()`, refuses to start with `PARMANA_STORAGE=supabase` and no
   `DATABASE_URL`.
2. `assertSigningKeyMaterialConfigured()`, materializes `PARMANA_KEY_MATERIAL_JSON` into
   `PARMANA_KEY_DIR` for any file not already present, then confirms `default.private.pem`/
   `default.public.pem` exist (skipped for `KEY_PROVIDER=aws-kms`, which has no local file for
   that key by design).
3. `await assertKmsSigningKeyReachable()`, for `KEY_PROVIDER=aws-kms` only: constructs a real
   `SignerBootstrap`-backed signer and confirms the configured KMS key actually exists and is
   reachable, before binding the port.
4. `assertPaytmConnectorConfigured()`, refuses to start with only one of
   `PAYTM_CONNECTOR_URL`/`PAYTM_CONNECTOR_SHARED_SECRET` set.
5. `createExecutionSystem()`, `createApplication()`, `createCallerAuthenticator()`,
   `createRateLimitStore()` (twice, once per limiter, see the tutorial 115 case study in
   Chapter 12), the actual application graph.
6. `app.listen(PORT, HOST)`, the port only binds after every check above has passed.
7. `runPolicyGovernanceIntegrityCheckAtStartup()` and
   `schedulePolicyGovernanceIntegrityCheck()`, fired _after_ the port is bound, deliberately
   fail-open (Chapter 14), these must never delay traffic from being accepted, unlike steps
   1-4.
8. `createGracefulShutdown()` wired to `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`.

The split between steps 1-4 (fail-closed, before the port binds) and step 7 (fail-open, after)
is a deliberate, named discipline, not an accident of ordering, durable storage and signing
key material are things a process cannot function without at all, while a Policy Governance
integrity mismatch is something to detect and log, not something that should keep a
healthy process from serving traffic.

## How it enables things, with a concrete example

Every tutorial in `examples/tutorials/` that spins up a real `createApplication()` instance
(the large majority of them) depends on `loadConfig()` succeeding first, `examples/tutorials/89-readiness-probe`
specifically exercises the boundary between "storage is configured but unreachable" (`NOT_READY`, 503) and "storage isn't configured to need reaching at all" (`READY`, memory-backed), which is
this exact configuration model in action. `examples/tutorials/113-kms-key-id-resolution`
exercises `resolveKmsKeyId()`, one concrete function this configuration ultimately drives
(Chapter 3 covers it in depth).

## How to validate this yourself

- `packages/shared/src/config/Config.ts`, `ConfigValidation.ts`, `StorageProviders.ts`,
  `KeyProviders.ts`, `SecretsProviders.ts`, `CryptoAlgorithms.ts`, `TrustProfiles.ts`, the
  full config model and its validation.
- `packages/api/src/bootstrap/assertStorageConfigured.ts`,
  `assertSigningKeyMaterialConfigured.ts`, `assertPaytmConnectorConfigured.ts`, the
  fail-closed startup checks, each with a doc comment explaining exactly what it prevents.
- `packages/api/src/server.ts`, the real, ordered bootstrap sequence.
- `packages/crypto/src/CryptoBootstrap.ts`, `KeyBootstrap.ts`, `SignerBootstrap.ts`, the
  three composition roots.
- `.env.example`, the canonical, heavily-commented variable reference (verify against
  `ConfigValidation.ts` for anything you're not sure is still accurate, per the `KEY_PROVIDER`
  drift noted above).

## Integration requirements

A minimal working `.env` needs, at least: `PARMANA_POLICY_DIR`, `PARMANA_KEY_DIR` (with a
real `default.private.pem`/`default.public.pem` pair present, or `PARMANA_KEY_MATERIAL_JSON`
set), and either `PARMANA_STORAGE=memory` (no further storage config needed) or
`PARMANA_STORAGE=supabase` plus `DATABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`/
`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Caller authentication needs either `PARMANA_API_KEYS` populated or
`PARMANA_AUTH_DISABLED=true` (development only). `KEY_PROVIDER=aws-kms` additionally needs
`AWS_REGION` and either `AWS_ROLE_ARN` (Vercel OIDC federation) or a real AWS credential chain
reachable in the runtime environment (`~/.aws/credentials` locally, an instance/task role
elsewhere).
