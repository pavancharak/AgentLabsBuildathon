/**
 * Constructs a fully-formed, internally-consistent BusinessTransaction
 * from the fields a caller actually decides, deriving every field the
 * server's own BusinessTransactionValidator checks for cross-consistency
 * (packages/runtime/src/validators/BusinessTransactionValidator.ts) so a
 * caller can never build a request that fails one of those checks by
 * mistake:
 *
 *   - metadata.businessTransactionId always equals businessTransactionId
 *   - authorization.authorityId always equals authority.authorityId
 *   - intent.authorizationId always equals authorization.authorizationId
 *
 * Hand-building a BusinessTransaction by writing out all five nested
 * objects and keeping three id pairs in sync by hand is exactly the
 * class of mistake that produced every "X must match Y" 400 response
 * documented in END-TO-END-FLOW.md (repo root) — this function exists
 * so that mistake is structurally impossible when going through the
 * SDK, not merely documented as something to be careful about.
 *
 * businessTransactionId defaults to a fresh crypto.randomUUID() if
 * omitted — a caller providing one explicitly is responsible for it
 * being unique per attempt, since it doubles as the server's own
 * idempotency key (see docs/site/guides/end-to-end-paytm-flow.mdx,
 * "businessTransactionId is an idempotency key").
