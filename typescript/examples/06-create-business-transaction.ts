/**
 * The same POST /execute flow as 02-execute.ts, built with
 * createBusinessTransaction() instead of writing out all five nested
 * objects and keeping three id pairs in sync by hand. Compare this
 * file to 02-execute.ts directly -- the difference is the entire
 * point: every "X must match Y" 400 response documented in
 * END-TO-END-FLOW.md (repo root) came from hand-building a request
 * and getting one of those pairs wrong. This function makes that
 * class of mistake structurally impossible.
 *
 * Targets test:fixture-execute, the same NODE_ENV=test-only capability
 * 02-execute.ts uses, so this example is hermetic and runs against any
 * local server with no external connector configured. To see this
 * reach a real business system (Paytm, staging), swap `action`,
 * `target`, `parameters`, and `policy` for the real paytm:refund shape
 * -- see docs/site/guides/end-to-end-paytm-flow.mdx /
 * END-TO-END-FLOW.md (repo root) for the complete, verified-live
 * version of exactly that, including every real error message you'd
 * hit along the way and why.
