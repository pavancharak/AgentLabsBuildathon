 * Tracked database migrations for any Postgres (G-61).

 * Applies each file in supabase/migrations/ once, in filename order, each in
 * its own transaction, and records it in `parmana_schema_migrations`. The
 * table is the same one the self hosted deployment's `migrate` service uses
 * (docker/local/migrate.sh), so a database can move between the two.
 *
 * Why: scripts/apply-all-migrations.sql applies every migration again on
 * every run, and on a database that already holds data an older migration
 * adds back an older CHECK constraint over newer rows, and fails. A database
 * that was set up that way has no record of what it has; `baseline` gives it
 * one without running anything.
