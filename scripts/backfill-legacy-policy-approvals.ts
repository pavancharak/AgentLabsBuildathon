/**
 * One-time, manually-invoked backfill: every (policyName, policyVersion)
 * with a live policy.json, no PolicyChangeApprovalRecord, AND no open
 * (PENDING_APPROVAL) proposal -- i.e. genuinely never touched by Policy
 * Governance at all -- gets exactly one synthetic PendingPolicyChange
 * (proposed and resolved by a fixed system identity, never a real
 * human) and its corresponding signed PolicyChangeApprovalRecord,
 * content unchanged.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes any (policyName, policyVersion) that already
 * has a real PENDING_APPROVAL proposal -- see docs/CLAIMS.md's own
 * "Legacy-policy backfill" entry: as of 2026-08-19 every one of this
 * system's real production policies already has a genuine,
 * human-proposed PendingPolicyChange awaiting a distinct human
 * checker. Those are reported separately (awaitingRealApproval) and
 * never synthetically approved -- doing so would fabricate governance
 * evidence for a decision no human has actually made, for content
 * that has a real maker-checker workflow already in flight.
 *

 * Why this exists: verifyPolicyGovernanceIntegrityAtStartup.ts and
 * scripts/verify-policy-changes-approved.ts (its own doc comment,
 * "--full-scan will report every policy version that predates Policy
 * Governance ... as unapproved -- expected, not a false positive")
 * both treat "no approval record at all" as permanently out of scope,
 * not as a mismatch to fix -- there is nothing for a legacy policy's
 * live content to be consistent *with*. This script closes that gap
 * once, deliberately, rather than leaving it open indefinitely: after
 * running with --apply, every live policy has an approval record, and
 * both of those checks actually cover the full set of live policies
 * from then on.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wired into server startup: this mutates the
 * durable approval-record audit trail (and, transitively, the
 * pending-policy-change history), which is exactly the kind of
 * consequential, hard-to-reverse action that should be a deliberate,
 * reviewed, one-time operation -- not implicit background magic that
 * reruns on every boot. Defaults to a dry run; pass --apply to
 * actually write.
 *
 * Never touches the live policy.json itself -- there is nothing to
 * write, since the content a legacy policy already has on disk *is*
 * the content this script attests to. contentHashBefore is
 * deliberately omitted (there is no prior *governed* state to name),
 * and contentHashAfter is the hash of that unchanged content.
